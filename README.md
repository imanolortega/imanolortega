## Hi 👋
I'm a Front-end developer at Easytechgreen. Before that, I was a graphic designer, digital marketing manager and a Communication Social Bachelor's degree student.

I started programming with Python in 2018 as a hobby, and since the end of 2019, I have been studying web programming.

I work with NextJS on the Frontend and usually with some CMS (headless or not) on the Backend. I have also worked with VueJS and React Native. My focus today is on the user experience: fast, intuitive, and accessible websites.
